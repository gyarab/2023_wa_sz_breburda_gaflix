She first became aware of voice acting when, after watching a stage play adaption of an anime, she read the stage pamphlet and asked her parents about a person mentioned in it. She found out that she wanted to become a voice actor at the age of six, and at elementary school she listed voice acting as her desired future career.\r\n\r\nIn middle school, Inori joined her school's tennis and theater clubs, however, she quit the theater club due to feeling too embarrassed when appearing on stage. Around the same time, her mother found a magazine advertising for a voice-acting audition, which she participated in and won.\r\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia, edited)\r\n\r\nNon-anime roles:\r\n\r\n    Iris - Memento Mori (VG)\r\n    Soline - Goddess of Victory: Nikke (VG)\r\n    Furina - Genshin Impact (VG)",
